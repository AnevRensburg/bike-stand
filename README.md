# Bike Stand

This website serves as a demo for a business specializing in selling mountain bike stands.

I have designed and implemented this website using HTML, Sass and CSS with Bootstrap. My approach avoids the use of website generators like WordPress and CMS platforms, allowing me to apply and enhance my skills effectively. This site is reactive and presents well on all mobile devices as well as full-sized computer screens.
